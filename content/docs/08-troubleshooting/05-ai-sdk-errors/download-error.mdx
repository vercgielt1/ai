# DownloadError

## When This Error Occurs

This error occurs when the AI SDK fails to download a file, typically an image, that was included as part of a prompt. It can happen in scenarios where:

1. The URL provided for the image is invalid or inaccessible.
2. There are network connectivity issues.
3. The server hosting the image returns an error status code.
4. The download process is interrupted or times out.

## What It Means

The `DownloadError` indicates that the AI SDK was unable to retrieve the file content necessary to include in the prompt. This can impact the functionality of multi-modal models that rely on image inputs alongside text.

## How to Resolve It

To resolve this error, you can try the following:

1. Check the URL: Ensure that the image URL is correct and publicly accessible.
2. Verify network connectivity: Make sure your application has a stable internet connection.
3. Validate content type: Make sure the content type of the file matches what's expected (e.g., image/png, image/jpeg).

If the issue persists after trying these solutions, you may need to investigate further by examining the specific error details provided in the DownloadError instance, such as the `statusCode` and `statusText`.

## Usage

```typescript
import { DownloadError } from '@ai-sdk/provider';

try {
  // Code that might result in a DownloadError
} catch (error) {
  if (DownloadError.isInstance(error)) {
    console.error(`Failed to download file from ${error.url}`);
    console.error(`Status: ${error.statusCode} ${error.statusText}`);
    // Handle the error appropriately
  } else {
    // Handle other types of errors
  }
}
```
