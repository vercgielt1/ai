# InvalidResponseDataError

## When This Error Occurs

This error occurs when the AI SDK cannot parse the response received from the AI provider.

## What It Means

The `InvalidResponseDataError` indicates that the response data from the AI provider is not in the expected format or structure. This could be due to various reasons, such as:

1. Changes in the API response structure that haven't been accounted for in the SDK.
2. Malformed data sent by the server.
3. Unexpected data types in the response.

## How to Resolve It

To resolve this error, you can take the following steps:

1. Check the `data` property of the error object to inspect the problematic response.
2. Ensure that your SDK version is up to date and compatible with the API version you're using.
3. If you're developing a custom provider, review your response parsing logic to handle potential edge cases.
4. [Open an issue](https://github.com/vercel/ai/issues/new/choose) on the GitHub repository.

## Usage

```ts
import { InvalidResponseDataError } from '@vercel/ai';

try {
  // Your code that might throw this error
} catch (error) {
  if (InvalidResponseDataError.isInstance(error)) {
    console.error('Invalid response data:', error.data);
    // Handle the error appropriately
  } else {
    // Handle other types of errors
  }
}
```
