# InvalidPromptError

## When This Error Occurs

The `InvalidPromptError` occurs when an AI provider is unable to process a given prompt. This error is typically thrown by providers when they encounter a prompt that doesn't meet their specific requirements or constraints.

## What It Means

When you encounter an `InvalidPromptError`, it means that the prompt you've provided is not suitable for processing by the AI model. This could be due to various reasons, such as:

1. The prompt is empty or null
2. The prompt exceeds the maximum allowed length
3. The prompt contains invalid characters or formatting
4. The prompt doesn't meet specific requirements set by the provider

## How to Resolve It

To resolve an `InvalidPromptError`, you should:

1. Check the error message for specific details about why the prompt is invalid.
2. Review the prompt to ensure it meets the provider's requirements.
3. Modify the prompt as needed:
   - Ensure it's not empty
   - Trim it if it exceeds the maximum length
   - Remove any invalid characters or formatting
   - Adjust the content to meet the provider's specific requirements
4. If the issue persists, consult the documentation of the specific AI provider for any additional requirements or constraints.

## Usage

```typescript
import { InvalidPromptError } from '@vercel/ai';

try {
  // Your code that might throw an InvalidPromptError
} catch (error) {
  if (InvalidPromptError.isInstance(error)) {
    console.error('Invalid prompt:', error.message);
    console.error('Problematic prompt:', error.prompt);
    // Handle the error or provide feedback to the user
  }
}
```
