# RetryError

## When This Error Occurs

The `RetryError` occurs in the following scenarios:

1. When the maximum number of retries has been exceeded.
2. When an error is encountered that is not retryable.
3. When the operation is aborted.

## What It Means

A `RetryError` indicates that an operation that was being retried has ultimately failed. This could be due to persistent issues with the operation, network problems, or intentional abortion of the process.

The error contains information about the reason for the failure and a history of the errors encountered during the retry attempts.

## How to Resolve It

To resolve a `RetryError`, consider the following steps:

1. Check the `reason` property of the error to understand why the retry process failed.
2. Examine the `lastError` and `errors` properties for more details about the specific errors encountered.
3. Based on the reason:
   - If `maxRetriesExceeded`: Consider increasing the maximum retry limit or addressing the underlying issue causing repeated failures.
   - If `errorNotRetryable`: Investigate the specific error that was deemed not retryable and address it directly.
   - If `abort`: Determine if the abortion was intentional or due to a timeout, and adjust your code accordingly.
4. Review your retry strategy and consider implementing exponential backoff or other advanced retry mechanisms.
5. Ensure that the operation you're retrying is idempotent to prevent unintended side effects from multiple attempts.

## Usage

Here's an example of how to handle a `RetryError`:

```typescript
import { RetryError } from '@ai-sdk/provider';

try {
  // Your operation that might throw a RetryError
} catch (error) {
  if (RetryError.isInstance(error)) {
    console.error(`Retry failed: ${error.message}`);
    console.error(`Reason: ${error.reason}`);
    console.error(`Last error: ${error.lastError}`);
    console.error(`All errors:`, error.errors);

    // Handle the error based on the reason
    switch (error.reason) {
      case 'maxRetriesExceeded':
        // Handle max retries exceeded
        break;
      case 'errorNotRetryable':
        // Handle non-retryable error
        break;
      case 'abort':
        // Handle aborted operation
        break;
    }
  } else {
    // Handle other types of errors
  }
}
```
