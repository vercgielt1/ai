# NoSuchToolError

## When This Error Occurs

This error occurs when an AI model attempts to call a tool that is not available or has not been defined in the current context.

## What It Means

The `NoSuchToolError` indicates that there's a mismatch between the tools the AI model expects to be available and the tools that are actually provided in the code. This can happen if:

1. The model is trained to use certain tools, but they haven't been implemented in your application.
2. There's a typo in the tool name either in the model's output or in your tool definitions.
3. The tool the model is trying to use has been removed or renamed.

## How to Resolve It

To resolve this error:

1. Check the `toolName` property of the error to see which tool the model was trying to use.
2. Verify that all tools the model might need are properly defined and passed to the model.
3. If the tool should be available, make sure its name in your code exactly matches what the model is trying to call.
4. If the tool is intentionally not available, you may need to adjust your prompt or model instructions to clarify which tools can be used.
5. Review the `availableTools` property of the error (if defined) to see the list of tools that are currently available to the model.

## Usage

```typescript
import { NoSuchToolError } from '@ai-sdk/provider';

try {
  // Code that might throw a NoSuchToolError
} catch (error) {
  if (NoSuchToolError.isInstance(error)) {
    console.error(`Model tried to use unavailable tool: ${error.toolName}`);
    if (error.availableTools) {
      console.log(`Available tools are: ${error.availableTools.join(', ')}`);
    }
  }
}
```
