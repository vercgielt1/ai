# NoObjectGeneratedError

## When This Error Occurs

This error occurs when using the `generateObject` or `streamObject` functions and the AI model fails to generate a parsable object that matches the specified schema.

## What It Means

The `NoObjectGeneratedError` indicates that the AI model was unable to produce a valid object structure based on the given prompt and schema. This could happen for various reasons:

1. The model's output doesn't conform to the expected JSON format.
2. The generated object doesn't match the structure defined in the provided schema.
3. The model failed to generate any meaningful output.

## How to Resolve It

To resolve this error, consider the following steps:

1. Review your prompt: Ensure that your prompt clearly instructs the AI model to generate the desired object structure.

2. Check your schema: Verify that the schema you've provided is correct and not too restrictive for the AI model to fulfill.

3. Adjust model parameters: Try modifying parameters like temperature or max_tokens to influence the model's output.

4. Use error handling: Implement proper error handling in your code to gracefully manage this error when it occurs.

5. Retry with backoff: In some cases, retrying the request with an exponential backoff strategy might help.

## Usage

Here's an example of how to handle this error:

```typescript
import { generateObject, NoObjectGeneratedError } from 'ai';
import { z } from 'zod';

async function generateRecipe() {
  try {
    const result = await generateObject({
      model: yourModel,
      schema: z.object({
        recipe: z.object({
          name: z.string(),
          ingredients: z.array(z.string()),
          steps: z.array(z.string()),
        }),
      }),
      prompt: 'Generate a simple recipe.',
    });

    return result.object;
  } catch (error) {
    if (NoObjectGeneratedError.isInstance(error)) {
      console.error('Failed to generate object:', error.message);
      // Handle the error (e.g., retry, use a fallback, or inform the user)
    } else {
      // Handle other types of errors
      throw error;
    }
  }
}
```
