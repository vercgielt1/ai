# EmptyResponseBodyError

## When This Error Occurs

This error occurs when an AI API request receives an empty response body from the server.

## What It Means

An `EmptyResponseBodyError` indicates that the AI provider responded to a request, but the response body was empty. This is unexpected behavior, as the response should typically contain data or an error message.

## How to Resolve It

To resolve this error:

1. Check your network connection to ensure there are no connectivity issues.
2. Verify that the AI service is functioning correctly and not experiencing any outages.
3. Review your request parameters to make sure they are valid and complete.
4. If the issue persists, contact the AI service provider's support team for assistance.

## Usage

```typescript
import { EmptyResponseBodyError } from '@vercel/ai';

try {
  // Your AI API request code here
} catch (error) {
  if (EmptyResponseBodyError.isInstance(error)) {
    console.error(
      'Received an empty response from the AI service:',
      error.message,
    );
    // Handle the empty response error
  }
}
```
