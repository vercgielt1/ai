# UnsupportedFunctionalityError

## When This Error Occurs

This error occurs when a user attempts to use a functionality that is not yet supported by the AI SDK or the provider.

## What It Means

The `UnsupportedFunctionalityError` indicates that the requested operation or feature is not available or not supported by the AI SDK. This could be due to various reasons, such as:

1. The functionality is planned for a future release but not yet implemented.
2. The feature is not compatible with the current version of the SDK.
3. The requested operation is not supported for the specific AI model or provider being used.

## How to Resolve It

To resolve this error, consider the following steps:

1. Check the AI SDK documentation to ensure you are using supported features and methods.
2. Verify that you are using the latest version of the AI SDK, as the functionality might be available in a newer release.
3. If the functionality is crucial for your application, consider using an alternative approach or workaround that is supported by the SDK.
4. Request the feature by opening an issue on the [AI SDK GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/ai/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=2.feature_request.yml)

## Usage

The UnsupportedFunctionalityError is used internally by the AI SDK. However, you can catch and handle this error in your code to provide more graceful error handling:

```typescript
import { UnsupportedFunctionalityError } from '@vercel/ai';

try {
  // Some operation that might throw an UnsupportedFunctionalityError
} catch (error) {
  if (UnsupportedFunctionalityError.isInstance(error)) {
    console.error(`Unsupported functionality: ${error.functionality}`);
    // Handle the error or provide an alternative solution
  } else {
    // Handle other types of errors
    throw error;
  }
}
```
