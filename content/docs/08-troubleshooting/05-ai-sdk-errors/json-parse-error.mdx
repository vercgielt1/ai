# JSON Parse Error

## When This Error Occurs

This error occurs when the AI SDK attempts to parse a JSON string but fails to do so. It typically happens when the input text is not valid JSON or when there are syntax errors in the JSON structure.

## What It Means

A `JSONParseError` indicates that the system received a string that it expected to be valid JSON, but encountered issues while trying to convert it into a JavaScript object. This could be due to:

1. Malformed JSON syntax
2. Unexpected characters in the JSON string
3. Incomplete JSON data

## How to Resolve It

To resolve a `JSONParseError`, you should:

1. Check the original JSON string for syntax errors.
2. Ensure that the JSON is complete and properly formatted.
3. Validate the JSON using a JSON linter or validator tool.
4. If the JSON is being generated programmatically, review the code that produces it to ensure it's creating valid JSON.

If you're receiving this JSON from an external source:

1. Contact the source provider to report the issue.
2. Implement error handling in your code to gracefully manage cases where invalid JSON is received.

## Usage

```typescript
import { JSONParseError } from '@vercel/ai';

try {
  // Some operation that might throw a JSONParseError
} catch (error) {
  if (JSONParseError.isInstance(error)) {
    console.error('JSON parsing failed:', error.message);
    console.log('Problematic text:', error.text);
    // Handle the error appropriately
  }
}
```
